Sendclip program Gtk version

This is gtk version of sendclip program writen in python. I developed it because of the qt version can not display app indicator on gnome3. It is compatible to latest version of the qt version of sendclip.
just run the `sendclip.py` script to start it.

Installation

Needs python-gi package installed on ubuntu.
